It's a simple and non thread-safe implementation of a hash table with LRU.
There is no remove operation, old elements will be recycled by the LRU.

My goal was to hide the internal complexity.

In order to reuse this implementation in an other project,
you will have to redefine content of structs ht_key and ht_value, and adapt
corresponding *_init, *_reset, *_cpy macros/functions
in hash_elt.h file.
You dont have to modify hash.c or hash.h files.

This implementation let user manage memory, allocating elements,
adding them to the hash table, and freeing them.
